Hypotheisis testing to see whether the tuition cost of students is less than 5386$ each year or not

**Methods Used**
- One sample t-test for mean since the population variance was not known
- Also the sample size was less than 30 observation so we chose the t-statistic
- Chosen significance level is 5%

**Conclusion**

- p-value came out to be 0.002 which is less than 5%. So at 5% level os significance, we
have enough evidence to claim that the average tuition cost of students is less than 5386$ each year.
